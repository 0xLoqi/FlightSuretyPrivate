# Progress Tracker

Environment Versions
Truffle v5.0.2 (core: 5.0.2)
Solidity - ^0.4.24 (solc-js)
Node v14.21.3

## 3/31/2022
### Notes
All Contracts are done I think, seem to be passing tests, pretty sure functionality is complete
probably would want to run through tests again (maybe just check rubric for requirements)

Front end (index.html) has all that's needed, css is fine, haven't tested functionality yet
Still need to stich together the index.js to the front end to the contract.js
Began working on prompt for this but it might not be relevant anymore (chat can be founder under "Fix Syntax in test script")

Also need to figure out how the oracles hook in exactly, I think I have a okay idea but need to test it out.

Also created a rubric that exists in notion

Due date is exactly 14 days away, should be easy to finish in time

### To get started again
Run npm run dapp to start server
ganache-cli -m "candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat" -a 20
Run npm run server to start server
Run Truffle Migrate if Operational Status isn't working in Dapp
